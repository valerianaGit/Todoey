# Todoey

This is an iOS app built in Swift. It is meant to keep your to do list in check. Check out the color gradients :) 

Used a few cocoapods too, thanks to all contributors!
Using Realm for data persistance, and the chameleonFramework for the colors! Also, once you are done with a task, you can swipe left to erase it, or tap on it and just mark it as finished.
